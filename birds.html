            <p>
                In 2021 after the loss of my parrot Louie to cancer, I began volunteering at the <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/birdparadise.org/">Berkshire Bird Sanctuary</a>.
                Every Sunday I'd drive an hour and 15 minutes through the Taconics to help clean the parrot and pigeon
                houses and spend hours with the beautiful rescue parrots.
                It was here I met Angeline, a moody <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur-crested_cockatoo">Sulfur-Crested Cockatoo</a> with a
                fused ankle and a few missing toes.
            </p>
            <p>
                She would hide in the back of her cage, and I'd never heard much of a peep from her, but one day while I
                was taking a break and walking around with one of the Umbrella Cockatoos, I noticed her watching. I put
                the Umbrella Cockatoo away and opened her cage and offered my hand to her. She stepped right up and
                snuggled against my chest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not a minute later, the owner of the sanctuary, Peter, came in. "I can't believe it -- she lets you hold
                her like that?" Turns out, Angeline had been surrendered to the sanctuary after biting off the finger of
                her previous owner. Yeowch!
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the next few months Angeline and I bonded. She would oddly walk across the floor to come sit in my
                lap during breaks, ride along on the food cart while I fed other birds, and occasionally take a shower
                in the hose spray while I cleaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2022, I brought Angeline home. She had never gotten along with the other birds at the
                sanctuary, and I was the only volunteer who she let handle her. Since then she's been living with me. 
                Her loud self-expression, able to be heard from a few houses down, has earned my
                home the title of "The House with the Bird". She's also inspired my personal logo!

            <h2> The Parakeets</h2>
            <p>
                In December of 2023, between flights on my return from Hawaii, I received a panicked series of texts
                from my friend in the village. A friend of hers who worked for a family, assisting a child with some
                learning disabilities, was trying to find a home for several parakeets. The child had entered a phase
                where they would harass the birds, and the family deemed it appropriate to rehome them.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my cat Paisley, Angeline, and a 150 yr old house on my hands, I wasn't eager to take in more birds,
                but my friend couldn't find anyone else, and I agreed, with intent to rehome them again when I found a
                suitable place. I tentatively named them after tropical fruits, inspired by the vacation I was returning
                from -- Papaya, Lychee, and Lilikoi.
            </p>
            <p>
                I moved them over to a healthier diet, from <a
                    href="https://www.kiwisnewlifebirdrescue.org/programs">seeds to pellets</a> supplemented with fresh
                veggies, and upgraded them from their awkward, dangerous cage to the longest one I could find to allow
                them to spread their wings.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a foster fail. The sounds of the little birds in the morning has been warming my heart, and they
                entertain each other enough to not need my constant attention like Angeline. Their beautiful colors and
                song have been a welcome precense in my home, and slowly they are becoming more friendly with hands!
