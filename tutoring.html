            Need help with math or physics? Let's work together! I am comfortable working with any student middle school and up.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cumulative nature of these subjects can feel overwhelming. Too often students get left
            behind, and as material builds, understanding can feel impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're starting Algebra for the first time, are rebuilding a foundation
            to take on a more complex subject, or just need a bit of assistance with a single assignment, I'm here to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm experienced in working with & developing strategies for students with ADHD and test anxiety, 
            and can help students establish and celebrate acheivable goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am available for online sessions, or in-person depending on your location.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I am currently accepting new students!</b><br>
            Rate is $25/hr for online sessions. Rate may vary for in-person depending on distance and for more complex subject material.<br>
        </p>
