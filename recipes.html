                <h2>My Recipes</h2>
                <h3>My Babysitter's Mac an Cheese (modified)</h3>
                <p>
                    My mother got the original recipe from my babysitter wayyy back when. It's been modified slightly. I
                    make this as an easy dinner and serve it with roasted vegetables! Brocolli or cauliflower is my
                    favorite.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Ingredients:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>1/4 c flour</li>
                    <li>smoked paprika</li>
                    <li>salt & pepper</li>
                    <li>2 cups full fat milk</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded cheese (I use good cheddar & a bit of parmesan. Don't use pre-shredded, it has
                        too much starch & will make your sauce gummy.)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp (or more, to taste) of Good mustard. Dijon, not whole seed.</li>
                    <li>8 oz cooked pasta; I like cavatappi</li>
                </ul>
                Melt butter in a saucepan. Mix in 1/4 cup flour, smoked paprika, salt, & freshly ground pepper. Stir and
                cook
                to make a roux. Once homogenous and thick, mix in 2 cups full fat milk. Whisk until thickened, try not
                to boil the milk. It’ll start
                out clumpy, and then seem too thin, and then it will thicken.
                Reduce heat to low. Add shredded cheese. Stir until melted.
                Once smooth, remove from heat and whisk in mustard of choice or more to taste. Taste for seasoning. Add
                8oz cooked
                pasta.
                <br><br>
                Optionally (I usually don't since it's meant to be a quick dinner), mix breadcrumbs and melted butter,
                pour the mac & cheese into a baking pan,
                top with breadcrumbs & more shredded cheese, and bake at 350 for 10 minutes or until brown on top.

                <h3>Oatmeal Coconut Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    This one's in cups because I made it with whatever I could find at my aunts while taking care of my
                    Oma once,
                    and she didn't have a scale!
                    I'll remake with weight sometime and post it here.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Ingredients:</b>
                <ul>

                    <li>1 c oats</li>
                    <li>1/2 c shredded raw coconut</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                </ul>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
                Cream butter and sugar, add egg, vanilla, almond extract, and zest.
                In another bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt
                Gently add the dry ingredients to the wet.
                Stir in oats and coconut.
                Roll into 1 tbsp balls and bake for 11-13 minutes.
